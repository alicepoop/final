                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Alice Wu, a passionate video editor and graphic designer. I have several years of experience working on various projects, from creating captivating video content to designing visually appealing graphics for clients around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My love for storytelling through visuals has driven me to continuously improve my skills and deliver outstanding results for every project I undertake. I believe that creativity knows no bounds and that each project is an opportunity to bring unique and
                    innovative ideas to life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not immersed in the world of video editing and design, you can find me playing golf, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, and playing video games with friends.
                </p>
